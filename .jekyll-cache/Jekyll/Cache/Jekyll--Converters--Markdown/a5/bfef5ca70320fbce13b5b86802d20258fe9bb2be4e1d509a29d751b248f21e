I"<p>Hi my name is Herbert and I am a web deveopler. A couple of my favourite languages are PHP and JavaScript. I have always enjoyed learning new things currently I am learning Angular.</p>

<p>Besides programming some of my hobbies are video games, baking and plants. I’ve been playing League of Legends since season 1. STill to this day my main game of choice. Baking is something thats a little new. I’ve always enjoyed baking but I now focus on sourdough. My sourdough starter is my levain for anything I bake from cookies to bread. Plants are a passion of mine. They are amazing on so many different levels. They clean your air, brighten my day and in my opinion  make good decor.</p>
