I"i<p>Hi my name is Herbert and I am a web deveopler. A couple of my favourite languages are PHP and JavaScript. I have always enjoyed learning new things, currently I am learning Angular. Here check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbert-lemus-a082246a/">Linkedin</a></p>

<p>Besides programming some of my hobbies are video games, baking and plants. Iâ€™ve been playing League of Legends since season 1; to this day it is still my main game of choice. Baking is something thats a little new, I have always enjoyed baking but I now focus on sourdough. My sourdough starter is my levain for anything I bake from cookies to bread. Plants are a passion of mine. They are amazing on so many different levels, they clean your air, brightens your day, and they have health benefits.</p>
