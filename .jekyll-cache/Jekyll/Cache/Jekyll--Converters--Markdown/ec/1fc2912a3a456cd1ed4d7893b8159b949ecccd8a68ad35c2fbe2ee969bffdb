I"D<p>Making your very own sourdough starter is as easy as mixing flour and water. First what is a sourdough start? A sourdough starter is a fermented mitxture of flour and water. The starter conatains colonies of living microorganisms such as yeast and lactobacilli. Just like any other living thing your starter will need food. But lets start with how you start a sourdough starter.</p>

<p>For a new starter you will need a glass jar(I use pasta sauce jars), flour preferably whole wheat/rye and bread flour, and last but not least water(the tempature of the water depends on your homeâ€™s tempature. hotter the room the cooler the water.). The fermention of the flour will take about 7 days. Day 1 add 50grams of each whole wheat and bread flour, and 100ml of warm water into your jar. Mix together until there are zero dry spots.</p>
