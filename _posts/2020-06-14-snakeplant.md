The snake plant is also known as Sansevieria is one of the easiest plants to take care of. They are native to Africa, Madagascar, and southern 
Asia. Snake plants have stiff upright leaves; which have gray, silver or gold edging. Given the room snake plants will grow pups(baby snake plants) that can be cut off after it developed its own roots. 

Sansevieria is versatile when it comes to light. They have a huge range from low to bright light. This gives them the ability to grow almost anywhere in your home. They don't need to be water that often let the soil dry then water well. I would check it every 2 days by sticking your finger in the soil to check if it is dry. They should be fed an all-purpose fertilizer every second month. I use a slow-release fertilizer.
