            <p>Making your very own sourdough starter is as easy as mixing flour and water. First what is a sourdough starter? A sourdough starter is a fermented mitxture of flour and water. The starter conatains colonies of living microorganisms such as yeast and lactobacilli. Just like any other living thing your starter will need food. But lets start with how you start a sourdough starter.</p>

<p>For a new starter you will need a glass jar(I use pasta sauce jars), flour (preferably whole wheat/rye and bread flour), and last but not least water(the tempature of the water depends on your homeâ€™s tempature. The hotter the room the cooler the water.). The fermentation of the flour will take about 7 days. Day 1 add 50grams of each whole wheat and bread flour, and 100ml of warm water into your jar. Mix together until there are zero dry spots; leave with the lid set on top(do not fully close)</p>

<p><img class="sub-image" src="/assets/images/raph.jpg" alt="Raphael" /></p>

<p>After 24 hours remove the lid and check for signs of fermentation in the form of bubbles at the top. A funky, acidic smell can be signs of the fermenetation starting. If zero bubbles are seen you can give it another 12-24 hours. Time to give your starter its first of many feedings. In a small mixing bowl pour in 100ml of water and 25grams of your starter. Mix together. Next add 50 grams of whole wheat flour and 50grams of bread flour. Mix together untill there are zero dry spots. clean out your jar and put the mixture in. Repeat daily</p>

<p>What do I do with the discard?!</p>
